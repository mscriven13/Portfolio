    My name is Maya Scriven and I am a US Citizen currently residing in Harlem. I live with my Grandma, mother and brother. I go to school at UNIS and have been going there since T1. I have interests in writing, playing guitar and most recently coding. I love archery, pogo sticking, roller blading and would love to have my own pair of stilts one day.
